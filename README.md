## Actionable insights For the campaigns 
- Collect additional data for Black Friday, New Year and Holiday campaigns and improve data recording for the future.
- Analyse impressions for Data Share Promo campaign instead of conversions.
- Plan promotions for Data Share Promo on Wednesdays, as this is the day users spend the most time.

## Actionable insights For users without a campaign
- Plan promotions or offers on Fridays, because this is where we see the highest conversion rates.
- Optimize engagement on the website, especially on Saturdays and Sundays.
- Track and analyze the types of products or content that result in conversions between 4 and 15 minutes.
Since most conversions happen between 4 to 15 minutes, optimize the website to encourage users to stay within this timeframe.
    - We could do this by showing popular products, making sure the website is easy to navigate, and by optimizing the checkout process.
